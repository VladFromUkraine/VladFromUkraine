Hello, my name is Vlad and I'm 21.
Since the war has begun I lost my job and home, however I managed to succesfully graduate from college and get a degree in English-Ukrainian interpreting.
Now it's time for me to begin a new journey, an outstanding one. I decided to become a Full-Stack Web developer nad I want to start with mastering Front End.
On my blog I will share my expirience and progress and I'd like you to visit and see it by yourself.
Thank you!
